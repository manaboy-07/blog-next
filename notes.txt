You can create new pages in the app by adding a folder component
Link uses href
you can use a loading state, in the folder just name loading.tsx
folders can also have error, error.tsx and go to docs and copy
Next js applies it automatically
read the docs

NextJS 13.1 (reference dave gray on yt): 
You can do smth like page.module.css, 
also create automatic loading states,
when you create a folder like about folder that contains the about pages

NextJs 13.2 replace head.tsx
Usage of metadata


Dynamic Routing:

loading ui, streaming an suspense




USEFUL NextJS thing for applications NextJs applies automatically:
1. loading with loading.tsx
2. error boundary error.tsx copy code from docs
3. provide built in not-found for error pages by convention of  not-found.tsx
